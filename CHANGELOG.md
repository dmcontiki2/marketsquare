# MarketSquare · CHANGELOG

---

## Session 1 · 28 March 2026 · Morning

### What was built
- Claude Code 2.1.84 installed via winget on Windows 11
- Project folder created: C:\Users\David\Projects\MarketSquare
- Master CLAUDE.md created with 5 operating principles
- Three agent folders created: agents/architect/ · agents/frontend/ · agents/admin/
- Each agent folder has its own CLAUDE.md defining its lane
- Git initialised, identity configured, first commit made
- Core files renamed (removed Windows duplicate suffix) and committed:
  - marketsquare_v8_6b.html
  - marketsquare_admin_v1_1.html
  - Solar_Council_Codex_v4_0.docx
- 360 Total Security whitelisted: Claude Code · Git · MarketSquare folder

### Operating principles locked
1. When unsure — make best guess, implement, flag uncertainty at end
2. Change size — one feature or bug fix per task, one file section at a time
3. Git — auto-commit after every completed task with descriptive message
4. Definition of done — working code + one-paragraph entry appended to CHANGELOG.md
5. Conflict arbitration — Architect agent arbitrates via Codex; escalate to David only if Codex cannot resolve

### Agent structure
- Architect agent · agents/architect/CLAUDE.md · owns Codex rules and system design
- Frontend agent · agents/frontend/CLAUDE.md · owns marketsquare_v8_6b.html
- Admin agent · agents/admin/CLAUDE.md · owns marketsquare_admin_v1_1.html

### Decisions made
- BEA and CityAutoRollOut agents deferred — add when those concepts have their own dedicated files
- GitHub setup deferred to Session 2
- Startup script deferred to Session 2

### Open items for Session 2
1. Build master briefing document for the 3 Claude Code agents
2. Set up GitHub for project backup
3. Build and test start_marketsquare.bat desktop startup script
4. Correct Codex — Solis is a ChatGPT/OpenAI persona, not a Grok agent
5. Correct Codex — 1 Tuppence = USD $2 (not $1)
6. Update agent CLAUDE.md files to reflect MarketSquare is a marketplace app, not a game

### Notes
- MarketSquare is a local marketplace app (not a game)
- Three agents are Claude Code agents, not ChatGPT/Grok/Claude mix
- Solis is a David persona used in ChatGPT — external to Claude Code setup
- 1 Tuppence = USD $2
- Pro plan in use — no additional costs beyond subscription

---

## Session 2 · 28 March 2026 · Afternoon

### What was built
- start_marketsquare.bat created — desktop startup script
  - Copies last CHANGELOG entry to clipboard
  - Opens claude.ai/new in browser
  - Opens trustsquare.co and trustsquare.co/admin.html
  - Launches Claude Code in Windows Terminal at project folder
- CHANGELOG.md created (this file)

### Open items continuing
1. Build master briefing document for the 3 Claude Code agents
2. Set up GitHub for project backup
3. Test start_marketsquare.bat end-to-end

---

## Session 2 · 28 March 2026 · Afternoon (continued)

### What was built
- AGENT_BRIEFING.md completed — master briefing document for all three Claude Code agents.
  Single source of truth covering: product overview, core concepts, file map, agent lanes,
  BEA API reference, infrastructure, operating rules, and pending items.
- GitHub repository set up at https://github.com/dmcontiki2/marketsquare
  - Account created: dmcontiki2 (dmcontiki2@gmail.com)
  - Empty repo created: marketsquare
  - All project files pushed to main branch with tracking set up

### All Session 2 open items resolved
1. ✅ Master briefing document — AGENT_BRIEFING.md
2. ✅ GitHub backup — github.com/dmcontiki2/marketsquare
3. 🔜 Test start_marketsquare.bat end-to-end — deferred to Session 3

### Notes
- From Session 3 onward, agents should read AGENT_BRIEFING.md at session start
- Future commits will be backed up to GitHub automatically via Claude Code auto-commit rule
- CLAUDE.md still describes MarketSquare as a game — update is pending (Session 2 open item 8)

---

## Session 3 · 30 March 2026 · Morning

### What was built

**Claude Code settings.json updated** — four settings configured:
- conversationRetentionDays: 365
- CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS: 150000
- CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE: 75
- CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS: 1

**Three critical bugs fixed in marketsquare_v8_6b.html:**
1. Category mismatch — BEA listings showing in wrong category. Fixed by adding normCat() function in loadLiveListings() to normalise BEA category strings (e.g. 'property', 'PROPERTY') to exact CATS keys ('Property', 'Tutors', 'Services').
2. Adverts not clickable — openDetail(id) was using LISTINGS[id] as an array index, which fails for BEA string ids like 'bea_3'. Fixed by adding findListing(id) helper that searches by value. Also fixed all onclick handlers that interpolated l.id without quotes, causing browser to treat 'bea_3' as an undefined variable.
3. Magic claim links broken — admin tool generated correct URLs but frontend had no code to read the URL params. Fixed by adding URLSearchParams parser on DOMContentLoaded that reads magic=1, name, email, cat, city params and routes straight to the onboard screen with fields pre-filled.

**Hardcoded demo data removed from marketsquare_v8_6b.html:**
- 6 hardcoded listings replaced with 3 placeholder cards (one per category) — dashed border, faded, non-clickable, labelled 'Awaiting first [category] seller'
- 6 hardcoded seller CVs replaced with 3 minimal placeholder sellers
- Hardcoded dashState listings replaced with empty array — populated by loadLiveDash() from BEA
- renderGrid() updated to show placeholders despite paused:true flag
- renderFeatured() updated with empty state message when no featured listings exist
- Results count excludes placeholders

**Server deployment issues resolved:**
- Identified correct nginx serve path: /var/www/marketsquare/ (not /var/www/html/)
- admin.html was missing from server — uploaded via SCP from local Windows terminal
- nginx config updated to add location = /admin.html block so it doesn't fall through to FastAPI
- Correct SCP commands for future deployments documented below

**360 Total Security false positive resolved:**
- atiuxp64.dll (AMD GPU driver) flagged on every startup — confirmed false positive
- Fix: exclude entire C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository folder in 360 settings

## Session 4 · 31 March 2026

### What was built
- `marketsquare_admin.html` upgraded from v1.0 (4-step wizard only) to v2.0 (full dashboard). The existing 4-step onboarding wizard is unchanged and now lives under the **Onboard** tab. Five new sections added via a fixed bottom nav bar: **My Listings** (fetch all BEA listings, filter by category, delete); **Seller Profile** (look up by email via `GET /users/{email}`, delete account); **Analytics** (live pending intro count + live listing count from BEA, with Coming Soon placeholders for BEA v1.2 metrics); **Account & Billing** (placeholder pending Paystack live mode); **Alerts** (load all pending intros from `GET /intros`, show 48hr countdown with colour coding, Accept/Decline buttons wired to BEA).

### Status at end of session
- marketsquare_admin.html (local) — v2.0 dashboard built ✅
- Needs SCP deploy to server to go live at trustsquare.co/admin.html

### Open items carried forward
1. Deploy marketsquare_admin.html to server (SCP command in AGENT_BRIEFING)
2. Maroushka real listings — add via admin tool
3. n8n email notifications — buyer emailed on intro accept/decline
4. Hetzner Object Storage — migrate photos off local /media
5. Update start_marketsquare.bat with correct SCP deploy commands
6–8. Codex corrections and agent CLAUDE.md updates (Architect agent)
9. Paystack live mode — pending CIPC registration

## Session 5 · 31 March 2026

### Completed in this session

**Planning and architecture (claude.ai):**
- Session 4 briefing completed — open items 1, 6, 7 confirmed done
- Admin dashboard spec defined: 5 panels (Profile, Listings, 
  Analytics, Billing, Alerts) with full field and metric breakdown
- Property filter gap analysis completed — buyer app filter sheet 
  missing 9 property types, Listing Type, Furnished, Pet Friendly, 
  Internet, 10 features vs admin tool
- Auto-research session protocol designed — OIM framework documented
  for future sessions

  claude.ai for all file editing tasks

**Deployment:**
- Both files deployed to server via PowerShell SCP:
  - marketsquare.html → /var/www/marketsquare/index.html
  - marketsquare_admin.html → /var/www/marketsquare/admin.html
- Correct local filenames confirmed: marketsquare.html and 
  marketsquare_admin.html (no version suffix on disk)
- AGENT_BRIEFING, CHANGELOG, CLAUDE, settings files still have 
  Windows duplicate suffixes — rename in Claude Code Session 5

## Session 6 · 1 April 2026

### Task 1 — Currency formatting

Added a shared `formatZAR(value)` helper to both `marketsquare.html` and `marketsquare_admin.html` that formats any numeric value as `R1,234,456.00` (capital R, comma thousands separators, two decimal places). Replaced all ad-hoc price display code: grid card prices, featured card prices, the detail modal price block, and the property filter range tag in `marketsquare.html`; and the listing queue cards (steps 3 & 4), the live listings manager price meta, and the deposit field in `marketsquare_admin.html`. The old `formatSAPrice` function (which used non-breaking-space thousands separators) has been removed and superseded. Values in storage are unchanged — formatting is display-only.

### Task 2 — Property description formatting

Added `formatDesc(desc)` to `marketsquare.html` which replaces the flat `<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">` description block in the listing detail screen with structured HTML. Rules: lines ending in `:` or short bare phrases (≤50 chars, no `.!?,;:`) become `<h4 class="desc-heading">` bold headings (trailing colon stripped); lines starting with `·`, `-`, `*`, or `•` become `<ul><li>` bullets; lines starting with `N)` or `N.` become `<ol><li>` items; remaining lines become `<p class="desc-p">` paragraphs. Consecutive list lines are grouped into a single `<ul>` or `<ol>` block. Four CSS rules added for the new classes. Stored description text is untouched.

### Task 3 — Photo gallery / image scrolling

Upgraded the listing detail screen image area in `marketsquare.html` to a full carousel when a listing has multiple photos. Changed `.photo-strip` from `overflow-x:auto` / scroll-snap to `overflow:hidden` + `scroll-behavior:smooth` so all navigation is JS-controlled with no native-scroll conflicts. Added `‹` / `›` arrow buttons (`.strip-arrow`) absolutely positioned at mid-left and mid-right of the strip, hidden when only one photo exists. Added `stripNav(id, delta)` which calculates the current index from `scrollLeft`, calls `scrollTo({behavior:'smooth'})` to the adjacent slide, then fires `updateStripDots` after 80 ms. Added `touchstart`/`touchend` listeners (passive) on the strip after each `openDetail` call: swipes >50 px trigger `stripNav` with the correct direction. Single-photo listings show the image statically with no controls, unchanged.

### Task 4 — Category listing counts (city-scoped)

Fixed the hardcoded category counts (12/11/8) on the home screen in `marketsquare.html`. Extracted `normCat()` from its previous location inside `loadLiveListings()` to module scope so it can be shared. Added `const ACTIVE_CITY = 'Pretoria'` as the single source of truth for the city filter, used in both the BEA `/listings?city=` query and the count function. Added `id="home-cat-grid"` to the categories div. Added `renderCatCounts()` which filters `LISTINGS` to non-placeholder entries (`!id.startsWith('ph_')`), normalises each `cat` value through `normCat()`, counts per key, and updates the `.cat-count` text in each tile. `renderCatCounts()` is called after `renderGrid()` and `renderFeatured()` completes in `loadLiveListings()`, so counts always reflect the live BEA data for the active city.
